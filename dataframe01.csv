"Jobseekers, this one’s for you.
 Every application, every interview, every follow-up… the pressure is immense.
 And I know what you're thinking: Am I not good enough? 
 But let me tell you, this isn’t about you or your skills. It’s about a broken system where 60% of applicants never hear back. 
 Your mental health is not worth sacrificing for a system that doesn’t acknowledge your worth. 
 Please remember, taking care of yourself is the real priority.

"Every time I poured my heart into 5-6 rounds of interviews and faced rejection, it felt like a punch in the gut. The sleepless nights, the endless preparation, all for nothing.

But looking back, I realize it wasn’t nothing. It was the Universe’s way of saying, “Not this one, something better is on the way.”

Every single time, I’ve been shown why that rejection happened.

Doors I thought I wanted to walk through were shut, only to have the right ones swing open.

The kind that aligned with my growth, my values, and my happiness.

At first, it stung. It hurt deeply. But now, when things don’t go as planned, I don’t panic.

I don’t question my worth. I sit back, breathe, and trust. The Universe knows.

I know there's another plan waiting. Something bigger, better, and just for me.

To anyone feeling the weight of rejection: trust that the closed doors are protecting you from something you can’t see right now.

Your path is being cleared for something even more beautiful.",206,15,English,"['Self Improvement', 'Motivation']",Long
"To everyone who's still looking for a job...

I see you. I feel you. 💔

Every rejection email feels like a punch in the gut, and every 'We'll get back to you' sounds more like 'You'll never hear from us.'

But I want you to know, you're not alone in this. 🌸

According to a study, 80% of jobseekers struggle with anxiety and self-doubt during their search. It's normal to feel lost, but it's not the end.

Take breaks, breathe, and remember, this doesn't define you. Your worth is not tied to an offer letter. 💥

Your mental health matters more than any job.",899,8,English,"['Mental Health', 'Job Search']",Medium
"Sometimes, we forget that a company’s brand name doesn’t define someone’s talent. It’s easy to get caught up in the 'big company = big talent' mindset, but that's not always the case.

I’ve had the privilege of working with people from smaller companies (lesser known) who blow me away with their skills and dedication. They don’t need a fancy title or a famous brand behind them to prove their worth.

I've seen the other side too—people in top-tier companies feeling lost, overwhelmed, or stuck, even though the world sees them as 'successful'.

Let’s stop attaching someone’s value to the company they work for. Freshers especially need to hear this—skills are what matter, not the size of the company behind them.

At the end of the day, happiness and growth don’t come from a brand name, they come from doing what you love and constantly improving your craft.",166,10,English,"['Self Improvement', 'Career Advice']",Medium
"So when I left a toxic work environment, I told my manager a simple thing and felt so good 😯

I just said-

'Hope your son gets a manager like you.
I hope that the manager behaves the same way as you did with me.
Thank you.'

Now tell me 1 thing-

She always said that she was a great manager.
Why will she get offended?

I just told her that I wish her son would get a manager like she was.

If you felt bad, then that means you were a bad manager and now you know it. 80

If you feel good, then take it as a blessing for your son and you'll really want someone to treat your son/daughter in the same way.

She cannot be even angry with me else it'll prove that she was not a 'great' manager.

Hope you all become the people that your sons/daughters will like to work under 🙏
